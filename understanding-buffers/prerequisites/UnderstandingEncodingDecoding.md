# Understanding Encoding and Decoding

---

## What Is Encoding?

- **Definition:**  
  Encoding is the process of converting human-readable data (such as text or images) into a format that computers can store and processâ€”namely, binary data (0s and 1s).
- **Purpose:**
  - Translates characters and other data into a series of bytes.
  - Enables computers to store, transmit, and manipulate information effectively.
- **Example:**  
  An image encoder takes a picture and converts it into a series of binary digits that represent pixel colors and other metadata.

## What Is Decoding?

- **Definition:**  
  Decoding is the reverse process of encoding. It converts binary data back into a human-readable form.
- **Purpose:**
  - Translates stored or transmitted binary data back into characters, images, or sounds.
  - Ensures that what was encoded can be correctly interpreted and displayed.
- **Example:**  
  An image decoder takes the binary data from an image file and reconstructs it into the picture that you see on your screen.
