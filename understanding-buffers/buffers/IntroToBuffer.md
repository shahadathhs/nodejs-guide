## 🧠 **Node.js Buffers - Notes**

### ✅ What is a Buffer?

- A **buffer** is a **container in memory**.
- It is a **fixed-size** piece of memory allocated when you create it.
- Buffer size must be **specified in bytes** (e.g., 4 bytes = 32 bits).

---

### 🧩 How Buffers Work

- When a buffer is created:
  - A specific amount of memory is **allocated**.
  - It is **filled with zeros** initially.
- Buffers are **not arrays**, but they are **similar**:
  - Have **indexed elements**.
  - Can **access and modify elements** via index (e.g., `buffer[2]`).
  - Each element in a buffer = **1 byte** = **8 bits**.

---

### 📌 Key Properties of Buffers

- **Fixed size**: Cannot be resized after creation.
- If you try to write more data than the buffer can hold, **extra bits are discarded**.
- Buffers are designed for **binary data handling**.
- **Efficient for moving data** (e.g., between file, network, or processes).

---

### 🛠 Use Cases

- Used to:
  - Read/write **binary data**.
  - Store incoming data (e.g., from files, network).
  - Perform **low-level memory operations**.
  - Temporarily hold data to **process or transfer** it quickly.
- Common in scenarios like:
  - Streaming a video file.
  - Handling raw binary protocols.
  - Manipulating raw bytes for encoding/decoding.

---

### ⚠️ Important Considerations

- You **cannot allocate** a buffer **larger than available memory**.
- Allocating a large buffer (e.g., GBs) instantly **reserves** that much memory.
- Your machine’s **available RAM** limits how big a buffer you can create.
- Node.js ensures each buffer is **isolated**—allocated only for your use.

- In the upcoming lessons:
  - You'll learn to **create, write, read, and manipulate** buffers.
  - You’ll see **real-world usage examples**.
