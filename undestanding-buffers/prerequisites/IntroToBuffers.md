# Intro to Buffers in Node.js

Buffers are fundamental in Node.js and computer science, crucial for handling binary data.

**Key Points:**

1. **Importance of Buffers:**

   - **Core Role:** They connect Node.js with binary data, enabling file operations, network requests, and inter-process communication.
   - **Essential Understanding:** Without buffers, it’s nearly impossible to manage low-level data operations in Node.js.

2. **Understanding Binary Data:**

   - **Definition:** Binary data consists of only two states—0 (off) and 1 (on).
   - **Ubiquity:** Every file, application, network request, and operating system on your computer is built on binary data.
   - **Representation Variations:**
     - **Modern:** CPUs use transistors (e.g., billions of transistors in modern devices).
     - **Historical:** Early computers used light bulbs to represent 0s and 1s.
     - **Wireless & Storage:** Wireless signals (waves) and storage devices (USBs, SSDs, etc.) also operate using binary representations.

3. **Role in Node.js:**

   - Buffers serve as the intermediary that allows Node.js to interpret and manipulate binary data.
   - They empower Node.js to perform tasks like file manipulation, network communication, and database interactions.

4. **Foundation Topics Before Deep Dive:**
   - **Binary Numbers:** Learn how numbers are represented using only 0s and 1s.
   - **Hexadecimal Numbers:** Understand another numbering system that simplifies binary data representation.
   - **Character Sets & Encodings:** Study how characters and text are encoded into binary data.
   - These topics provide the necessary background for a deeper understanding of buffers.
